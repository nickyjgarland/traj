Abstract = {{In this paper, I investigate how eighteenth-century antiquarians engaged
   with the remains of Roman bath buildings in Britain and discuss their
   multifaceted attitude towards the ancient practice of bathing, with a
   focus on the city of Bath. I also examine the interests and priorities
   of Georgian scholars in studying Roman baths and their structure,
   highlighting their sometimes uncritical use of Classical sources and
   tracking the origins of their misconceptions regarding the components
   and function of these facilities. Finally, I briefly address the elusive
   socio-cultural legacy of Roman baths and bathing in eighteenth-century
   Britain, stressing influences and differences in practice and
   architecture.}},

   Status as a Roman Archaeophyte}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{49-74}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Roman period sees the introduction of many new plants and animals
   into Britain, with a profound impact on people's experience of their
   environment. Sweet chestnut is considered to be one such introduction,
   for which records of sweet chestnut wood and charcoal from
   archaeological excavations of Romano-British period contexts have been
   used as evidence. This paper reviews the records for sweet chestnut in
   Britain pre-A.D. 650, by critically evaluating original excavation
   reports and examining archived specimens. This review re-assesses the
   original identifications of sweet chestnut and/or their dating and
   concludes that most of the evidence that justified sweet chestnut's
   status as a Roman archaeophyte is untenable. The review emphasises the
   importance of securely identifying and directly dating plant material
   and of long-term curation by museums and archives.}},

Abstract = {{The evidence of the character and purpose of settlements previously

   of the more extensively excavated settlements: Alcester, Cambridge,
   Godmanchester and Worcester. In the absence of convincing urban
   attributes, it is suggested that this category of settlement should more
   appropriately be regarded as defended villages (vici). These cluster in
   and around the West Anglian plain and on Ermine Street, suggesting a
   strategic function to protect grain and other food supplies and their
   movement, potentially either to the northern frontier or south to London
   and, perhaps, export to the Continent.}},

Abstract = {{In late summer, sometime between cal A.D. 340-405, a hoard of tightly
   packed, stacked copper-alloy vessels was deposited in the Vale of
   Pewsey, Wiltshire. The corrosion of the vessels allowed for the
   preservation of delicate plant macrofossils and pollen. Analysis of this
   material has provided insights into the date, season and context of this
   act of structured deposition. A second hoard of similar vessels was
   deposited in the fourth or fifth century only a few miles away at
   Wilcot. The hoards and their deposition relate to Romano-British
   lifeways, at a time when the region was on the cusp of a dramatic period
   of change. The distribution of late Roman coins and belt fittings offers
   further insights into the social and economic character of Wiltshire at
   their times of deposition.}},

   ancient sources, but that might be called calendrical clepsydrae' .(1)

Abstract = {{The Roman fortress at Carpow, Perthshire, was excavated in 1961-62 and
   1964-79. The gates of the fortress are the key to our understanding of
   its occupational history. The suggestion made here is that they were
   initially constructed in timber, at the same time as the associated turf
   rampart, but were soon replaced in stone specifically to support heavy
   dedication slabs set above them. A new arrangement of the surviving
   inscribed fragments at the East Gate is proposed, and new readings
   adopted, which confirm their traditional Severan dating.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Roman military presence at Dalswinton is reassessed using a range of
   remote sensing techniques (geophysical survey, LiDAR and aerial
   photography). At Bankfoot the absence of internal buildings suggests the
   postulated vexillation fortress was a more temporary structure; while
   numerous pits/ovens were identified across the interior of the large
   Stracathro-type camp. The primary fort at Bankhead was provided with
   in-turned entrances and two small annexes attached to the north-west and
   south-east quadrants of the fort. A third much larger annexe extended
   southwards down to the river. Only pits and furnaces were recorded
   within the annexes, two of which were expanded in Phase 2. Various
   buildings, including legionary and auxiliary barracks, were identified
   in the expanded fort of Phase 2, whose orientation remained unchanged. A
   mixed garrison of legionaries and auxiliary cavalry is indicated for
   both periods of occupation. Finally, the fort was deliberately
   demolished. The Roman attribution of the three nearby enclosures at
   Butterhole Brae can no longer be supported.}},

Title = {{Tilestones into Whetstones in Seven Steps: the Brownstones, Pennant
   Sandstone and Stonesfield Slate at Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum), North
   Hampshire}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{321-330}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Roughly two-thirds of an assemblage of 156 whetstones from three
   collections representing two late Roman sites at Silchester can be
   assigned geologically to the Brownstones (Devonian), Pennant sandstone
   (Carboniferous) or Stonesfield Slate (Jurassic), imported from the west
   and north into the town as roof-tiles. The latter were put to further,
   secondary use as whetstones, some small and portable but others large
   and laid flat and kept stationary. The whetstones are polished through
   use, typically on both faces, and a high proportion carry grooves. On
   some the grooves are short and fine and could represent the sharpening
   of such items as pins, needles, meat skewers, styli and engraving tools.
   These grooves are typically found on whetstones from Insula IX, where
   artisanal and, at best, `light-industrial' activities are recorded. At
   the forum-basilica, by contrast, the whetstones are more substantial and
   typically show large grooves of two kinds that point to the shaping and
   finishing in considerable numbers of iron objects such as knives,
   cleavers, swords and even possibly ladles. The industrial activity at
   this site had a distinctly `heavier' quality. The biography of these
   whetstones - objects seemingly simple and unpretentious - was complex,
   wherever they were found.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{1-51}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper represents the final publication of excavations by Brian
   Hartley in the northern annexe of the Roman fort at Slack, West
   Yorkshire, carried out half a century ago, but still providing rare
   evidence for activity within an annexe and the nature of its defences.
   Hartley concluded that the annexe enclosed a civilian vicus of
   Trajanic-Hadrianic date, although its defensive enclosure was provided
   only in the Hadrianic period. This report upholds that conclusion. In
   the light of recent claims of later Roman occupation at Slack, Hartley's
   conclusion that the site was abandoned by c. A.D. 140 is examined and
   upheld. It is proposed that a second annexe at Slack enclosed the fort
   baths (and possibly a mansio) and by examining the Slack annexes in the
   context of other fort/annexe plans an attempt is made to distinguish
   between annexes enclosing fort vici and those enclosing official or
   military activities.}},

Abstract = {{Exceptional aspects of the design and location of a pair of
   first-century fortlets on the Exmoor coast are explicable as a product
   of local influence. Previous explanations for the remote setting of
   these small posts and the distinctive defences securing them have
   focused on a signalling role, with the fortlets serving as a means to
   transmit messages to naval vessels patrolling the Bristol Channel.
   Instead, both the landscape setting and articulation with local
   settlement patterns imply that these installations strengthened
   pre-existing measures to counter coastal raiding. Parallels between this
   variant fortlet design and settlement morphology in the South-West
   peninsula suggest that the army co-opted an indigenous architectural
   style. The two fortlets could act as components of what was effectively
   a composite coastal cordon, built on collaboration between the Roman
   military and the local population.}},

Abstract = {{In the summer of A.D. 122, Hadrian (A.D. 117-38) visited Britain as part
   of his first major journey. It is broadly accepted that the construction
   of Hadrian's Wall was inaugurated on this occasion. Following recent
   advances in Upper Germany where the limes palisade is now known to have
   been under construction when Hadrian visited the province, this paper
   re-examines the various strands of evidence for the early chronology of
   the Wall. It is argued that work started well before A.D. 122 and that
   it was in fact the `fort decision' which resulted from the imperial
   visit. The revised sequence offers a fresh perspective on several
   classic Wall problems and prepares the ground for a new understanding of
   unique features like the milecastles and Vallum.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of long-distance alignments in Roman surveying is
   increasingly being recognised. It has now been discovered that they were
   used in setting out the central sectors of the Antonine Wall, but - in
   contrast to Hadrian's Wall - it appears that they were employed to
   determine the locations of the military installations along the Wall
   rather than the line of its rampart and ditch. It also appears that the
   enigmatic enclosures and expansions which are attached to the rear of
   the rampart of the Wall only seem to occur in connection with these
   alignments. A careful analysis of possible explanations indicates that
   the Romans may initially have sought to set up a two-level alarm system
   across the central sectors of the Antonine Wall, the possible impacts of
   which upon the planning and design of the Wall are examined. The
   Supplementary Material available online
   (https://doi.org/10.1017/S0068113X18000284) contains a table of
   inter-visabilities between known military installations, and OS grid

Abstract = {{Excavations at Barnwood, Gloucestershire, revealed several phases of
   activity dating to the A. D. 60s. This included gravel quarrying, with
   one quarry pit containing a significant assemblage of pottery, metalwork
   and glass with strong first-century military associations. A large
   roadside enclosure contained ditches and a post-hole alignment; these
   were replaced by a square burial plot containing a post-built structure
   and several pits, which yielded a lead ossuarium containing cremated
   human remains and a collection of burnt beans and hobnails. The location
   of the site raises questions regarding the organisation of the military
   landscape around Gloucester during the first century. The Supplementary
   Material available online (https://doi. org/10.1017/S0068113X18000272)

Abstract = {{Bells are recorded in many published excavation reports from Roman
   sites, but there has been no previous study of the British material.
   This paper explores the significance of bells in the Roman world from
   both a ritual and a functional perspective. We create a first typology
   of Romano-British bells, provide an understanding of their chronology
   and examine any spatial and social differences in their use. Special
   attention is paid to bells from funerary or ritual contexts in order to
   explore the symbolic significance of these small objects. Bells from
   other parts of the Roman world are considered to provide comparisons
   with those from Roman Britain. The paper demonstrates that small bells
   were used as protective charms and may have been preferentially placed
   into the graves of children and young women. The paper identifies a new,
   probably Roman type of bell that has no parallels within the Empire,
   although similar pieces occur in first-and second-century graves in the
   Black Sea region.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{This research explores the contribution bioarchaeology can make to the
   study of slavery in Roman Britain, responding to the calls by Webster
   and colleagues for the greater use of osteological and scientific
   techniques in this endeavour. It reviews the evidence for the bodies of
   the enslaved in the primary sources and bioarchaeological evidence from
   the New World and the Roman Empire. The paper aims to establish patterns
   of physiological stress and disease, which could be used to reconstruct
   osteobiographies of these individuals, and applies these findings to
   bioarchaeological evidence from Britain. It concludes that at the
   present time, it may not be possible for us to successfully separate out
   the enslaved from the poor or bonded labourers, because their life
   experiences were very similar. Nevertheless, these people are overlooked
   in the archaeological record, so unless we attempt to search for them in
   the extant evidence, the life experiences of the majority of the
   Romano-British population who were vital to its economy will remain lost
   to us.}},

Abstract = {{The Iron Age and Roman periods are often defined against each other
   through the establishment of dualities, such as barbarity-civilisation,
   or spiritual-rational. Despite criticisms, dualities remain prevalent in
   the National Curriculum for schools, television, museum displays and
   academic research. Recent scientific studies on human origins, for
   example, have communicated the idea of an `indigenous' Iron Age, setting
   this against a mobile and diverse Roman-period population. There is also
   evidence for citizens leveraging dualities to uphold different positions
   on contemporary issues of mobility, in the UK and internationally. This
   paper discusses values and limitations of such binary thinking, and
   considers how ideas of ambiguity and temporal distancing can serve to
   challenge attempts to use such dualities to map the past too directly
   onto the present, reflecting on recent social media debates about
   Britain and the European Union.}},

Abstract = {{The ancient sources for the location of Thule are reviewed. It is
   suggested that the identification of the Shetland Isles as Thule was an
   error by Agricola. The identification was then accepted by Ptolemy, who
   moved Thule from the more northerly location implied by Pytheas' account
   to the site of the Shetland Isles. This would account for his
   description of Thule/Shetland as one island. The coincident location of
   Ptolemy's Thule with Shetland suggests that the Roman fleet did see the
   islands. The emendations of Wolfson relating to Thule are examined and
   rejected. There is no evidence that Agricola's fleet landed in Shetland.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{1-17}},
Abstract = {{On the Stanegate near Vindolanda two milestones are still in situ. The
   complete eastern one lacks an inscription. Only the base of the western
   one survives, cut down and split c. 1815; but eighteenth-century
   antiquaries read an inscription on it, now recognised as secondary, and
   a little of a primary text, probably naming Hadrian and perhaps a
   Tungrian unit. Writing-tablets and inscriptions show cohors I Tungrorum
   at Vindolanda in the late first and early second century, so it may have
   set up the milestone. Evidence from elsewhere names army units as
   road-builders on milestones. The distance between the Stanegate
   milestones is greater than the `standard' length, hence perhaps the
   so-called pes Drusianus was used. The final section discusses the
   secondary inscription.}},

Title = {{The Minories Eagle: A New Sculpture from London's Eastern Roman Cemetery}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{19-35}},
Abstract = {{The limestone sculpture of an eagle firmly clasping a serpent in its
   beak was recovered from within the eastern Roman cemetery of London on
   the last day of excavations at 24-26 Minories, EC3 in September 2013.
   The sculpture, which is dated stylistically to the late first or early
   second century A.D., had been carefully buried within the backfill of a
   roadside ditch no later than the mid-second century. The Minories eagle
   is one of the finest and earliest examples of freestone sculpture from
   the London cemeteries and presumably adorned the tomb of a rich and
   important individual or family located nearby. Petrological analysis of
   the sculpture has revealed it is carved from oolitic limestone quarried
   from the south Cotswolds. The article presents the context of the
   findspot and a detailed description of the eagle sculpture with an
   in-depth discussion of the iconography of the image and the results of
   the petrological examination. The Supplementary Material available
   online (http://journals.cambridge.org/bri) presents an account of the
   site stratigraphy, integrated with the specialist finds and the
   environmental reports.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has advanced our understanding of human crania found in
   London's upper Walbrook valley, where skull deposition appears to have
   peaked during the occupation of the Cripplegate fort, itself probably
   built soon after London's Hadrianic fire. Although this fire is usually
   considered to have been accidental, parallels can be drawn with London's
   Boudican destruction. This article explores the possibility that these
   three strands of Hadrianic evidence - fire, fort and skulls - find
   common explanation in events associated with a British war of this
   period. This might support the identification of some Walbrook skulls as
   trophy heads, disposed as noxii in wet places in the urban pomerium.}},

   distribution and building reclamation and, inter alia, identifies
   Hucclecote villa as such a site. It proposes that Gloucester tiles
   stamped just RPG were issued annually and were used for commercial
   purposes while tiles with magistrates' names were issued as required,
   but only for use on public buildings. The evidence suggests that these
   stamps were subsequently extensively curated. This paper adds nearly 200
   new stamps to the existing catalogues and proposes significant revisions
   to the magistrate dies as a result.}},

Abstract = {{In tandem with the large-scale translocation of food plants in the Roman

   Archaeobotanical evidence is used alongside material culture to evaluate
   the movement of these plants and plant items into Roman Britain, their

   ornamental gardens and ritual activities. Archaeobotanical evidence for

Title = {{Between Roundhouse and Villa: Assessing Perinatal and Infant Burials
   from Piddington, Northamptonshire}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{195-219}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of perinatal and infant individuals is common in the
   excavation of Iron Age and Romano-British domestic sites. In recent
   years, the discovery of many such burials has led to interpretations of
   infanticide and unceremonious disposal. Although this has been a widely
   discussed phenomenon, much of the literature has focused on the funerary
   context, and the biological age and sex estimates of these individuals,
   with little consideration of the palaeopathological evidence. This
   article provides a detailed analysis of 17 perinates/infants from the
   late Iron Age/early Roman site of Piddington, Northants. It discusses
   the skeletal evidence for poor health and growth, and highlights the
   potential of these remains to reveal alternative insights into perinatal
   and infant death. Evidence of growth changes and pathological lesions
   were identified, suggesting that these individuals experienced chronic
   episodes of poor health that affected their skeletal development. The
   study explores the implications of these findings within the context of
   Iron Age and Roman Britain. At Piddington, the death of these infants is
   not associated with the cultural practice of infanticide, but occurred
   due to poor health, highlighting the precarious nature of infant
   survival in the past.}},

Pages = {{221-252}},
Abstract = {{Childhood palaeopathology remains an underutilised resource in the study
   of Roman Britain, particularly for exploring the lives of the rural
   population. Lesions in child skeletons provide unique insights into past
   lifeways and population health, as adverse environmental conditions
   translate more readily into the osteological record of these vulnerable
   members of society. To demonstrate the range of information gleaned from
   the children, 1,279 non-adults (0-17 years) from 26 first-to
   fifth-century urban and rural settlements were analysed, comparing
   morbidity and mortality in the most comprehensive study to date. The
   distribution of ages-at-death suggests migration between country and
   town, the latter presenting a stressful and unsanitary environment.
   However, as demonstrated by high rates of metabolic disease and
   infections, life in the countryside was hampered by demanding physical
   labour and potentially oppressive conditions with restricted access to
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The Museum of London selected four individuals for multidisciplinary
   scientific analyses in order to establish their ancestry, aspects of
   their personal appearance and health. We also reinterpreted their burial
   context in order to better understand how identity was constructed and
   expressed in this unique Roman settlement. Our study discovered the
   presence of people with Black and White European ancestry, some of whom
   had migrated from the southern Mediterranean. The most surprising result
   was that Harper Road woman's chromosomes were male. Overall, our
   experience of undertaking a multidisciplinary study served to further
   underline the need for these different techniques to be used in
   combination when investigating past identities. The mtDNA results were
   very broad and required the mobility isotopes to better understand their
   significance, while the aDNA evidence confirmed the osteological
   analysis. In terms of public engagement at the Museum of London, the
   ability to determine hair and eye colour had a significant impact.}},

Title = {{Embodied Identities in Roman Britain: A Bioarchaeological Approach}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{177-194}},
Abstract = {{Human skeletal remains from Roman Britain are abundant and provide a
   rich repository of social as well as biological information concerning
   health, migration, diet and body/society interactions. At present,
   skeletal remains tend to be marginalised in studies of Roman trade, the
   military, economy, urbanisation and the like, yet they have huge
   potential to contribute to current debates. This article aims to
   highlight the potential of bioarchaeological analysis for understanding
   aspects of social identity in Roman Britain through the use of a more
   integrated, theoretical approach towards embodied interactions. It
   encourages future collaborative scholarship between bioarchaeologists,
   archaeologists and historians. The social determinants of health and
   identity will vary greatly between regions and the only way of
   establishing the diversity of life across the Roman Empire is through
   the instigation of a more comprehensive, large-scale, integrated study
   of funerary and skeletal assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{A hoard of objects found at the early Roman colony at Colchester in a
   small hole scraped into the floor of a house destroyed during the
   Boudican revolt includes a group of high-quality gold jewellery, three
   silver military awards, a bag of coins, an unusual silver-clad wooden
   box and other items. Buried in haste as the British approached, they
   provide a remarkably clear image of one couple's background,
   achievements, taste and social standing. A bulla shows that the man was
   a Roman citizen, the awards that he was a veteran soldier of some
   distinction, while parallels for the woman's jewellery suggest that it
   was acquired in Italy.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses a not well-known funerary monument commemorating
   a centurion of British descent. IGLS 13.1.9188 records the centurion, T.
   Quintius Petrullus, `from Britain', of the Third Cyrenaican Legion, who
   died aged 30 at Bostra in Arabia. This was a young age for a centurion
   and the article suggests that he had entered the army by a direct
   commission rather than risen through the ranks. Accordingly, he is
   likely to have belonged to a high-status family. The Bostra appointment
   was probably his first. The appointment is put into context alongside
   other similar equestrian career paths and the Jewish War during the
   reign of Hadrian is proposed as a possible occasion for the posting. In
   addition, the article examines this Briton alongside other Britons
   abroad.}},

Title = {{Continental Potters? First-Century Roman Flagon Production at Duxford,
   Cambridgeshire}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{43-69}},
Abstract = {{Excavations in Duxford, Cambridgeshire, in 2013, revealed six early
   Roman (A.D. 50-80) pottery kilns. The kilns were used for the production
   of flagons, specifically collared and ring-necked varieties. Flagons are
   generally scarce in contemporary domestic assemblages in Cambridgeshire,
   often only occurring in `special' contexts, such as burials, while
   collared flagons are closely associated with military consumption. The
   excavations also produced a large, significant assemblage of perforated
   kiln plates. The technology and repertoire of vessels suggest that
   manufacture was conducted by non-local potters for a specialist market.
   The site forms part of a group of other early Roman kiln sites in the
   Cambridge environs and adds to the growing picture of pottery production
   in the decades following the Roman Conquest.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{119-168}},
Abstract = {{Excavations to the east of the Roman fort of Inveresk in 2010 partly
   uncovered remains of a Mithraeum - the first from Scotland and the
   earliest securely dated example from Britain. A large rectangular sunken
   feature with lateral benches contained two altars buried face down at
   its north-western end. One was dedicated to Mithras, with iconography of
   both Mithras and Apollo as well as libation vessels. The other was
   dedicated to Sol, with a frieze above showing the Four Seasons. The Sol
   altar had a recess in the rear for a light which would have shone
   through his pierced rays, eyes, mouth and nose. Remains of an iron rod
   behind the nose hint at a more complex arrangement to create special
   visual or acoustic effects. Paint and plaster traces were recorded on
   both altars. The dedicator, G(aius) Cas(sius) Fla(...), a centurion, may
   have been in command of the garrison or of a legionary detachment.
   Stylistic links, especially in letter form, connect the work to
   sculptors of Legio XX. The stones and pigments are most likely from
   local sources. Little of the setting could be explored but there were
   traces of a precinct. A pit beside the Mithraeum included a large part
   of a well-used fineware beaker, which represented a deliberate offering.
   The Supplementary Material available online
   (http://journals.cambridge.org/bri) contains detailed descriptions of
   the altars, observations on the stone-working technology, lithology and
   pigment analysis, with extensive illustrations.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial Roman ponds present in various guises, but they are

   the potential of a pond for the reconstruction of wider landscape usage,

   some light on social practice. A review of similar sites across Roman
   Britain suggests there may be practical (in essence curatorial) issues
   about the fuller investigation of such features once identified, in
   order that a similarly high level of data can be achieved more
   regularly, and suggests a need for prospection/mapping for the better
   management of this resource, especially employing newly available LiDAR

Abstract = {{Excavation of the latest surviving structures of the villa at Batten
   Hanger in West Sussex indicates that a large aisled building was
   demolished in the late fourth or fifth century and replaced by a large
   hall 31.6 m long by 11.5 m wide, orientated approximately east-west. The
   survival of pad stones shows this space to have been divided into seven
   bays, with the more westerly bays screened off by a cross wall. The east
   wall of the building had collapsed outwards and was largely complete. A
   coin of Valentinian III suggests that occupation continued at least to
   the middle of the fifth century. The Supplementary Material available
   online (http://journals.cambridge.org/bri) contains a detailed
   presentation of the coin hoard and the pottery assemblages.}},

Title = {{Museum Representations of Roman Britain and Roman London: A
   Post-colonial Perspective}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{209-241}},
Abstract = {{This paper offers a post-colonial analysis of past and present
   representations of the archaeological remains of Roman Britain and Roman
   London in the British Museum and Museum of London respectively. Since
   post-colonial criticism of Romano-British archaeology is highly relevant
   to such an analysis, a brief description is provided at the outset.
   Thereafter follows a series of six case studies - three for each museum.
   The first four focus on the history of the Romano-British collections at
   both museums and sometimes draw on post-colonial insights to explain the
   development of these collections and the ways in which they were
   exhibited. The last two case studies investigate how British
   post-colonial criticism of Roman archaeology has (or has not) impacted
   on the current displays of the Romano-British collections at both
   museums. Finally, some recommendations will be offered based on the
   outcomes of these two case studies. Recurring themes are the
   representation of: the Roman military; Roman imperialism; the (material)
   culture of Roman Britain and Roman London.}},

Abstract = {{Regional and temporal patterns in brooch use in Britannia are studied,
   confirming and challenging `received wisdoms' about `regionality'. The
   complexity of the `Fibula Event Horizon' is brought into sharp focus; a
   similarly complex and unexplained `Fibula Abandonment Horizon' is also
   clearly demonstrated. Conclusions are insensitive to assumptions about
   use-life. Detailed analysis for the family of trumpet brooches casts
   light on hitherto unappreciated features of `regionality'. Comparison
   with continental data suggests the British temporal patterns may be
   reflecting a wider north-western province pattern. Under-studied aspects
   of bias in metal-detected finds and their implications for studies of
   this kind are noted. The Supplementary Material available online
   (http://journals.cambridge.org/bri) contains tabular information on the
   data used in the study and additional analyses that support some of the
   assertions made in the main text.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{99-118}},
Abstract = {{This paper attempts to put the Gorgon from the pediment of the Temple of
   Sulis Minerva at Bath into a wider provincial context, by arguing for
   links between the Gorgon and first-and early second-century imitations
   in Gaul and Spain of the iconography of the Forum of Augustus in Rome.
   These imitations, part of what might be called a `visual language of
   empire', served to connect the urban spaces of the provinces to Rome; by
   linking the Gorgon to this trend and setting aside interpretations of
   the Gorgon which have focused on his perceived status as a
   `Romano-Celtic' masterpiece, we can justify more satisfactorily his
   position as the centrepiece of a pediment dominated by imperial imagery.}},

   the guidelines thereby defined, the distribution of millstones is

   What types of mills were in use, and when? What were those mills used

Abstract = {{Pipe-clay figurines are an important but under-examined category of

   imported to Roman London from Gaul during the first and second centuries
   A.D. As in many other collections Venus figurines are the most common
   type, although there is considerable diversity in form. Comparison with
   continental collections highlights distinctive patterns of consumption
   between London, the rest of Britain and Gaul, with the city displaying
   relatively high numbers of exotic/unusual types, as appears to be
   typical of Londinium in general. The spatial distribution of the
   figurines is mapped across the settlement, while their contexts and
   social distribution on habitation, trade and religious sites throughout
   the city are explored. Whole specimens from burials and subtle patterns
   of fragmentation also provide a direct insight into the religious
   beliefs and symbolic practices of the people of Roman London.}},

   relates to military ideas of strength and virility, but in the context

   Chichester Harbour, probably during the visit to Britain by the emperor
   Hadrian in the early A.D. 120s. The Hawkshaw portrait of Trajan appears
   to have been refashioned from a likeness of Domitian and may originally
   have been part of a monument created to celebrate and commemorate the
   total conquest of Britain, in the early A.D. 80s, which was decapitated
   and buried during a period of unrest on the northern frontier.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},

Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{171-189}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of infant burials on excavated domestic sites in Roman
   Britain is fairly common but in the past these burials have often been
   dismissed as a product of unceremonious disposal. There is a growing
   literature which considers the phenomenon, but it has been dominated by
   debates around the suggestion that these burials provide evidence for
   infanticide, with a focus on the osteological evidence for and against
   this hypothesis. There has been less systematic consideration of the
   archaeological context of such burials. In this paper we examine the
   excavated evidence of two large groups of such burials from sites in
   East Yorkshire which demonstrate that the burial of neonatal infants
   followed a careful age-specific funerary rite. We suggest that this
   conclusion further undermines the widespread assumption that infants
   were disposed of without ceremony and as a result of infanticide.}},

Title = {{The Late Roman Field Army in Northern Britain? Mobility, Material
   Culture and Multi-Isotope Analysis at Scorton (N Yorks.)}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{191-223}},
Abstract = {{At Hollow Banks Quarry, Scorton, located just north of Catterick (N
   Yorks.), a highly unusual group of 15 late Roman burials was excavated
   between 1998 and 2000. The small cemetery consists of almost exclusively
   male burials, dated to the fourth century. An unusually large proportion
   of these individuals was buried with crossbow brooches and belt
   fittings, suggesting that they may have been serving in the late Roman
   army or administration and may have come to Scorton from the Continent.
   Multi-isotope analyses (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and strontium) of nine
   sufficiently well-preserved individuals indicate that seven males, all
   equipped with crossbow brooches and/or belt fittings, were not local to
   the Catterick area and that at least six of them probably came from the
   European mainland. Dietary (carbon and nitrogen isotope) analysis only
   of a tenth individual also suggests a non-local origin. At Scorton it
   appears that the presence of crossbow brooches and belts in the grave
   was more important for suggesting non-British origins than whether or
   not they were worn. This paper argues that cultural and social factors
   played a crucial part in the creation of funerary identities and
   highlights the need for both multi-proxy analyses and the careful
   contextual study of artefacts.}},

Abstract = {{Archaeological fieldwork in the Forth-Clyde isthmus has been dominated
   by the World Heritage Monument of the Antonine Wall, the Roman frontier
   built in the second century A.D. Considerably less attention has been
   given to the evidence for post-Roman experience of the Wall and how it
   was remembered (and forgotten) in the subsequent centuries. This paper
   will briefly summarise historical notices of the Antonine Wall, then
   consider the archaeological and toponymic evidence for early medieval
   occupation. The role of the Forth-Clyde isthmus as a political frontier
   is shown to be less significant to our understanding of this period than
   the evidence for mobility, memory and the contested legacy of Rome in
   early medieval Scotland.}},

Title = {{The British Expedition of Septimius Severus}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{31-51}},
Abstract = {{Archaeological evidence has emerged over the last half century which
   helps shed light on the British expedition (A D. 208-11) of the emperor
   Septimius Severus and his sons, famously but meagrely reported by the
   historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Excavation at the Severan
   supply-base at South Shields, full publication of excavations of the
   1960s and 1970s at the fortress of Carpow on the Tay, and more recently
   at Cramond, and recent work on the indigenous societies encountered by
   the Romans, all offer new perspectives. The archaeological evidence is
   reviewed in conjunction with the historical. A critical assessment is
   made of: (1) the widespread belief that personal or political
   considerations brought Severus to Britain rather than actual need for
   military intervention; (2) recent claims that the fortress at Carpow was
   founded earlier under Commodus (A.D. 180s) and abandoned even before the
   Severan expedition; (3) the widespread assumption that Severus wished to
   occupy Scotland permanently and thus be the first conqueror of the whole
   of Britain; (4) the prevailing view that Carpow and Cramond were
   abandoned and that all Roman activity in Scotland ceased abruptly on
   Severus' death in February 211, and that the campaigns brought about a
   period of peace in third-century Britain.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{53-120}},
Abstract = {{The report summarises results from an excavation site within the Wotton
   cemetery on the outskirts of Gloucester. A total of 20 cremations and 54
   inhumations were excavated and are the subject of a detailed human bone
   report. The earliest cremation urns were of pre-Flavian date and could
   be paralleled by pots from the Kingsholm fortress. Cremation rite
   continued into the early second century, but was then replaced by
   inhumation burials. These dated from the later first/early second
   century till the fourth century. Part of a ditched enclosure, perhaps
   with an earlier precursor, was laid out in the second century and
   survived, respected by burials, into the later Roman period. The layout
   of this part of the Wotton cemetery is not in the orderly rows expected
   for urban burial in the province and this circumstance is compared both
   with other urban cemeteries and with practices known on rural sites.
   Analysis of the human bone suggested working people were buried in this
   part of the cemetery. At least one of the burials seems likely to have
   been a soldier and another may have been a person of importance very
   late in the life of the town.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{121-163}},
Abstract = {{Hoards of denarii are common in Britain and the number which have been
   recorded in detail means that it is now possible to suggest reasonably
   accurately what a `normal' hoard of a particular date should look like.
   That being the case, we can then look for variation around that norm and
   both investigate and speculate what that variation means. A methodology
   is developed which suggests periods of faster and less rapid coin
   circulation which has implications for consideration of monetisation.
   The model also enables us to view where denarii entered circulation;
   unsurprisingly the army looms large in this picture. The methodology is
   directly transferable to other provinces and other periods where there
   are long-lived, relatively stable monetary systems.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{165-194}},
Abstract = {{Over 800 clay coin moulds, excavated from 85 London Wall in 1988, had
   been used for casting copies of silver denarii and copper-alloy dupondii
   and asses which dated from Trajan to Trebonianus Gallus. The discovery
   of the moulds in the ditch of Londinium's defensive wall led initially
   to thoughts that this was the concealment of incriminating evidence, but
   it is now recognised that counterfeiting coins was rife and perhaps even
   uncontrollable. The wide variety of moulds made it a complicated task to

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{195-221}},
Abstract = {{A hoard found in Southbroom, Devizes in 1714 contained a group of
   copper-alloy figurines executed in both classical and local styles and
   depicting deities belonging to the Graeco-Roman and Gallo-Roman
   pantheons. The deities in a local style appear to form part of a larger
   tradition of figurines, predominantly found in the South-West, which are
   characterised both by a similar artistic style and by the use of
   Gallo-Roman symbolism and deities, such as the torc, ram-horned snake,
   carnivorous dog and Sucellus. The unique composition of the hoard in
   comparison with other hoards of similar date provides insights into the
   beliefs of Roman Britain.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{223-242}},
Abstract = {{A half-life-sized copper-alloy head of a bearded man was published in
   the Portable Antiquities Scheme's report of finds from Roman Britain in
   2009.(1) The head was purchased by the Ashmolean Museum in 2011. In this
   paper evidence for the identification of the subject as a portrait of
   the emperor Marcus Aurelius is reviewed by comparison with metropolitan
   and other certainly identified heads of deities and portraits of the
   emperor. The technique and likely function of the head are compared with
   those of similarly worked Roman copper-alloy heads of emperors and
   deities found in South-East Britain. Finally, a brief account is given
   of geophysical survey and trial excavation conducted in 2012-13 in the
   field where the head was found. This offers a unique opportunity to
   explore the head's archaeological context.}},

Abstract = {{Damage to part of the earthwork at Dyke Hills, Dorchester on Thames,
   provided the opportunity to recover the badly disturbed remains of a
   late Roman burial which had contained an elaborate belt set and an axe.
   This burial, of a type very unusual in Roman Britain, is argued to be of
   early fifth-century date and to be directly comparable with well-known
   burials recovered near by in 1874 which formed a starting point for the
   `soldiers and settlers' debates of the 1960s and beyond. The Dorchester
   burials are seen here as those of late Roman military personnel, and
   their local and wider context is discussed.}},

Title = {{Thinking about Roman Imperialism: Postcolonialism, Globalisation and

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{1-25}},
Abstract = {{For the last twenty years or so, archaeologists of Roman Britain, among
   other provinces, have been seeking ways of moving beyond the concept of
   `Romanisation' as a framework for thinking about Roman imperialism. Many
   of the ideas proposed have been drawn from two related bodies of thought
   which have emerged as ways of understanding the contemporary world:
   postcolonialism and globalisation theory. While achieving significant
   success in transforming interpretations of the Roman world, applications
   of these approaches present some fresh problems of theoretical and
   practical coherence. These in turn point to important issues to do with
   the role of theory in Roman archaeology, issues which have rarely been
   tackled head-on but which present obstacles to interdisciplinary
   dialogue. The aim of this paper is to evaluate and compare the
   perspectives of postcolonial and globalisation theories, assess their
   strengths and weaknesses, and suggest some possibilities for linking the
   insights of these and other approaches to define a more holistic agenda
   for Roman archaeology.}},

Title = {{Cunobelinus' Bronze Coinage}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{27-83}},
Abstract = {{Cunobelinus was the most significant figure in Britain during the
   decades leading up to the Roman invasion, though his reign has received
   relatively little attention. Cunobelinus' coinage is of great importance
   to understanding the socio-political structure of South-East Britain
   prior to the Roman invasion and whilst studies of his gold and silver
   have been published in previous editions of Britannia (Allen 1975; de
   Jersey 2001), his bronzes have been subject to surprisingly little work,
   particularly considering that they are by far the most common struck
   bronze issues known from Iron Age Britain, with a total of 2,608
   examples currently recorded in the Celtic Coin Index and on the PAS
   database combined. This study proposes a broad typological scheme with
   which Cunobelinus' bronzes can be ordered and demonstrates that, like
   Cunobelinus' silver, but unlike his gold, they can be divided into three
   regional groupings, which it can be argued correspond to three different
   political sub-groupings under Cunobelinus' control. In addition, the
   bronze's metallurgy and metrology and the mints at which they were
   struck are investigated. This article examines the contribution of
   coinage to understanding Cunobelinus' political history, and how he used
   imagery to reinforce and legitimate his power in the different regions
   under his control at different times during his reign. The types of
   sites at which Cunobelinus' bronzes have been found are also outlined
   and the likely function of the coins discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical earthwork and geophysical surveys have advanced our
   understanding of the lozenge-shaped Roman fort at Whitley Castle (
   Northumberland), which is notable for the exceptional depth of its outer
   defences. Built at a higher altitude than any other fort in England, it
   was almost certainly positioned to control the production and shipment
   of lead and silver from the Alston ore-fields. Its curious shape,
   tailored to that of the natural knoll, necessitated some adjustment of a
   standard fort plan, but accommodated six buildings to the rear of the
   central range and four to the front. An extramural settlement and
   terraced fields have been recorded to the west and north, and a swathe
   of ground to the south may have provided space for a parade ground.
   Post-Roman activity is evident from the cultivation and settlement
   remains that override the defences; two bastle-like buildings and an
   eighteenth-century farmhouse once stood within the fort itself.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 1977, rescue excavations of a square, ditched
   enclosure were undertaken at Rothwell Haigh Colliery, Leeds. Relatively
   few discrete features were identified, but a 12.3 m-deep well situated
   within the enclosure was fully excavated. Pottery from the well, which
   was waterlogged from c. 7 m, indicates rapid infilling most likely in
   the early to mid-fourth century. Waterlogged wooden objects include a
   yew bucket, ash spade with iron shoe and ash drinking vessels, while the
   disposal of complete pottery vessels, a quern disc rough-out,
   articulated animal parts and a human skull highlight the potential for
   symbolic deposition. An exploration of the apparently more mundane items
   shows that they deviate from the normal domestic patterns seen on local
   sites, suggesting that selection for ritual deposition may have covered
   areas of material culture not normally associated with such activity.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{45-113}},
Abstract = {{Occupation at Bainbridge began in the governorship of Agricola. Little
   is known of the first fort; the visible remains represent a successor
   fort, established in c. A. D. 85 at the earliest, abandoned under
   Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, and reoccupied in c. A. D. 160. In the early
   Severan period, the size of the unit at the fort seems to have been
   greatly reduced in numbers, and a suite of rooms for an officer was
   inserted in the principia. Extensive work by cohors VI Nerviorum which
   took place in c. A. D. 205-7 included the building of new principia, the
   relocation of the east gate, and probably the addition of an annexe, its
   wall described in an inscription from the site as a bracchium. The fort
   was held until the end of the Roman period, by which time the principia
   had been partly demolished to provide space for a timber building
   probably accommodating the commanding officer. The aedes and part of the
   rear range seem to have stood until the ninth or tenth century, when the
   former was possibly converted into a church. Knowledge of this sequence
   of occupation depends largely on the results of Brian Hartley's
   excavations which are published here. The main focus of the report is on
   the remarkable series of principia, but a review of what is known of the
   overall archaeology of the fort is also included in the main text. The
   Supplementary Material (http:// journals.cambridge.org/bri) contains a
   more detailed analysis of some of the other excavations together with
   various specialist reports.}},

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},

Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{135-166}},
Abstract = {{Despite being an intriguing, if obscure, series of artefacts there has
   been a hesitancy in academic discussion to address fully the myriad of
   questions raised by the design and archaeological find-spots of lead
   tanks from Roman Britain. This, and an uncritical acceptance that they
   were used by early Christians as baptismal fonts, has led to a lack of
   appreciation of their contribution to our knowledge of late
   Romano-British religion. This paper seeks to redress this via two
   channels. The first is a detailed and contextualised examination of the
   design, iconography and manufacture of these tanks. The second is an
   investigation into how the manner of their deposition can inform their
   function. It is concluded that the evidence used to associate the tanks
   with baptism is flawed and greater attention must be given to other
   facets of their design in order to gain an appreciation of their proper
   place in the culture and religion of Roman Britain.}},

   Transition Period and Beyond: Rings made from Romano-British Bracelets}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{167-215}},
Abstract = {{Documenting a phenomenon that has previously been overlooked, this
   article examines the later stages of object biography in relation to
   Romano-British bracelets, namely, their modification and subsequent
   re-use as smaller rings. Re-use is shown to occur widely and is
   particularly associated with the late fourth to early fifth centuries A.
   D., with cut-down bracelets also found in early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries.
   The making of smaller rings from late Roman bracelets is demonstrated to
   be part of a wider phenomenon of re-use, repair and recycling at the end
   of the Roman period in Britain, with attendant implications of cultural
   and economic change. It is proposed that the transformation of these
   artefacts was accompanied by changes in meaning which undermine the
   apparent continuity that is seen in the extended lifespan of the
   original object. This in turn illuminates the way that wider cultural
   norms were gradually eroded in the fifth century. Through the study of
   these artefacts a new perspective is provided on the transition to
   post-Roman Britain and the relationship between this and the early
   Anglo-Saxon period.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the written evidence for attacks by Scotti on fourth-century
   Roman Britain provides a historical context for the introduction of two
   hitherto overlooked references to Scotti in the works of Epiphanius,
   Bishop of Salamis on Cyprus (c. A. D. 315-403). Examination of
   Epiphanius' Ancoratus and Panarion confirms that he inserted the
   ethnonym into patristic source-material in the early 370s. These
   passages claim attention as unique testimony to the Scotti in Greek
   literature and the second earliest witness to this term in Roman
   sources. Their date prompts the conjecture that the barbarica
   conspiratio that beset Britain in A. D. 367-68/9 was a widely reported
   event even before its significance was magnified by Theodosian dynastic
   propaganda.}},

Title = {{Roman Grain Pests in Britain: Implications for Grain Supply and

Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{243-262}},
Abstract = {{It is over 30 years since Paul Buckland first presented a series of
   arguments concerning beetle (Coleoptera) grain pests: their origin, the
   timing of their introduction to Britain, and their implications for
   agricultural production during the Roman occupation. Here we return to
   the topic in the light of new data from a range of archaeological
   deposits, including civilian and military sites dating from the earliest
   period of Roman occupation. Infestation rates and, potentially, grain
   loss may have been high throughout Roman Britain, though many
   infestations may have been in equine feed. Beetle grain pests are not
   recorded in Britain prior to the Roman invasion, and it appears that
   they were absent, or extremely rare, in the early medieval period and up
   to the Norman Conquest. This pattern of occurrence is reviewed and it is
   suggested that ecological theory offers an explanation which is in
   accord with supposed socio-economic changes and trade. The role of grain
   pests is considered in the economic modelling of Romano-British
   agriculture.}},

Title = {{The Saga of Verulamium Building XXVII 2}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{263-274}},
Abstract = {{Recent debate about the dating of Building XXVII 2 at Verulamium
   highlights a potential conflict between archaeological and stylistic
   dating of mosaics. The stratigraphic and artefactual, particularly the
   numismatic, evidence for the dating of the construction of Building
   XXVII 2 and subsequent phases of activity are examined in detail. The
   coin finds indicate a late date (after c. A. D. 380) for the initial
   construction of this building and its mosaics, with a sequence of
   development suggesting the continuation of urban life well into the
   fifth century. This dating has been challenged, however, and it has been
   suggested that the mosaics, stylistically, are significantly earlier.
   Comments are offered on the stylistic dating of the Verulamium mosaics
   in an Appendix by Patricia Witts. In conclusion, there would appear to
   be no compelling reason why the historically important sequence of
   structures, suggesting the continuation of urban life in Verulamium well
   into the fifth century, as originally proposed, has to be rewritten.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Romano-British-Early Medieval Transition: A
   Zooarchaeological Perspective from Wroxeter (Viroconium Cornoviorum)}},
Journal = {{BRITANNIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{275-305}},
Abstract = {{The demise of the Western Roman Empire combined with Germanic migration
   and influence from Continental Europe had a tumultuous and profound
   affect on the cultural and social identities of Britain's population.
   The fifth to seventh centuries A. D. remain a poorly understood epoch in
   British history, hence the once traditional `Dark Ages' label. A variety
   of factors have contributed to this phenomenon, which include the exact
   nature and timing of the Roman administration's abandonment of
   Britannia, the precise character and extent of Germanic migration,
   questionable historical sources, the paucity of physical evidence, and
   problematic artefact dating. Zooarchaeological analysis can, therefore,
   aid the elucidation of this period through the development of new
   perspectives, highlighting the socio-cultural (and economic) processes
   involved in the emergence of early medieval Britain from Roman
   Britannia. Large-scale excavations were carried out at the baths
   basilica of Wroxeter (Shrops.) between 1966 and 1990. The city was the
   fourth largest urban centre in Roman Britain, and was the
   civitas-capital of the Cornovii. The excavations demonstrated how the
   public buildings of this central insula fell into disuse, prior to the
   possible construction of a grandiose private residence and complex in
   the sub-Roman period. It has been postulated that this building
   represents the palatial complex of a tyrannus, or possibly a bishopric
   of the `Western British' church. Analysis of the resultant animal bone
   assemblage has provided an opportunity to explore the social and ethnic
   identity of the site's inhabitants through their dietary habits.}},
